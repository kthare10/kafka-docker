# Apache Kafka in Docker

## What is Kafka?
Apache KafkaÂ® is a distributed streaming platform. What exactly does that mean?
A streaming platform has three key capabilities:

Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
Process streams of records as they occur. See official documentation [here](https://kafka.apache.org/intro)!
